### ðŸš€ About Me
I am a computer programmer who loves to learn new skills of any kind, as long as they can be beneficial to others and to me, I will keep learning about programming, music, business, nutrition, history, and more. If I can make all these things my hobbies, then I will keep learning. Because I don't want to do something just for work, but I want to enjoy what I do as part of my job.

  
## Skills
### Programming :computer:
- JavaScript
- CSS/SCSS
- HTML
- jQuery
- Linux shell
- VBA

One of my favorite pieces of code that I wrote while creating my resume a couple of months ago was the bar graphs that showed my level of programming experience.

Here is an image of the final result:

You can achieve this using the following HTML
## HTML code

```html
<div class="bars">
                <h2 class="bars__title">EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML5</li>
                    <div class="rectangle">
                        <div class="inner__Rectangle--1"></div>
                        <h4>91%</h4>
                    </div>
                    <li>CSS/SCSS</li>
                    <div class="rectangle">
                        <div class="inner__Rectangle--2"></div>
                        <h4>85%</h4>
                    </div>
                    <li>j-Query</li>
                    <div class="rectangle">
                        <div class="inner__Rectangle--2_5"></div>
                        <h4>80%</h4>
                    </div>
                    <li>Figma</li>
                    <div class="rectangle">
                        <div class="inner__Rectangle--3"></div>
                        <h4>70%</h4>
                    </div>
                    <li>MOS Applications</li>
                    <div class="rectangle">
                        <div class="inner__Rectangle--4"></div>
                        <h4>75%</h4>
                    </div>
                </ul>
            </div>
```

And remember to add the following code to your .CSS file
## CSS code

```css

.bars{
    grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end: 29;
    grid-row: 38/140; 
}

/* This controls position on the title*/
.bars__title{
    text-align: center;
}

/* This manages the font and position of the different abilities.*/
.bars li{
    font-family: roboto_medium;
    font-size: 20px;
    margin-right: 41px;
    padding-top: 55px;
}

/* This section created the rectangle (bar) that will be used in all my skills,
by default the rectangles will be displayed in white color*/
.rectangle {
    height: 15px;
    width: 245px;
    background-color: white;
  }

/* This first inner__rectangle--1 as well as the following 3, will shown the lightblue*/
  .inner__Rectangle--1 {
    height: 15px;
    width: 223px;
    background-color: var(--my_lightBlue);
  }

  .inner__Rectangle--2 {
    height: 15px;
    width: 208.25px;
    background-color: var(--my_lightBlue);
  }

  .inner__Rectangle--2_5 {
    height: 15px;
    width: 196px;
    background-color: var(--my_lightBlue);
  }

  .inner__Rectangle--3 {
    height: 15px;
    width: 171.5px;
    background-color: var(--my_lightBlue);
  }

  .inner__Rectangle--4 {
    height: 15px;
    width: 183.75px;
    background-color: var(--my_lightBlue);
  }

  .rectangle h4{
      float: right;
  }


  .mobile_version{
    display: none;
}
```
The variable *--my_lightBlue* shown in `var(--my_lightBlue);` It's a variable that I set with my own personal background color to show the approximate experience in percentage of the different skills. You can replace that variable with your own perfered color, such as `background-color: green;`.
